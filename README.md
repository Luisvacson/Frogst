Last update:
1.New BGM for the first character (by Luisvacson).
2.Now you can pause the game, then back to game or exit to main menu.
3.Now you can change the volume by clicking the "GEAR" icon and pulling the slider.

Next update:
New Characters, and so on.

The major developer of this game is Cloudiannn actually.

Luisvacson offered the bgm and helped with the program uploading.

To dear Luisvacson:
  Heartily thanks.    --Cloudiannn
